# delos
What time or when, O my soul, wilt thou sing of holy Delos, nurse of Apollo? Surely all the Cyclades most holy of the isles that lie in the sea, are goodly theme of song. But Delos would win the foremost guerdon from the Muses, since she it was that bathed Apollo, the lord of minstrels, and swaddled him, and was the first to accept him for a god.
Callimachus, Hymn to Delos
## Dedicated to Artemis the Archer, Twin of Apollo
In the shadows of mountains and in the wind on mountain-tops She loves to take her bow, Her bow made all of silver, And shoot off her shafts of woe. The peaks of great mountains tremble. The forest in its darkness screams. The whole earth starts shaking even the sea, the sea-life. And when she has hung up this unstrung bow, When she has put away her arrows, She puts on over her flesh a beautiful dress. Then she begins the dances.
Homer, Hymn to Artemis
## First Principles
Just as, when perfected, a human is the best of animals, so also when separated from law and justice, he is the worst of all.
Aristotle
