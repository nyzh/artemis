# Delos
"What time or when, O my soul, wilt thou sing of holy Delos, nurse of Apollo? Surely all the Cyclades most holy of the isles that lie in the sea, are goodly theme of song. But Delos would win the foremost guerdon from the Muses, since she it was that bathed Apollo, the lord of minstrels, and swaddled him, and was the first to accept him for a god."  
Callimachus, Hymn to Delos
## Dedicated to Artemis the Archer, Twin of Apollo
"In the shadows of mountains and in the wind on mountain-tops She loves to take her bow, Her bow made all of silver, And shoot off her shafts of woe. The peaks of great mountains tremble. The forest in its darkness screams. The whole earth starts shaking even the sea, the sea-life. And when she has hung up this unstrung bow, When she has put away her arrows, She puts on over her flesh a beautiful dress. Then she begins the dances."  
Homer, Hymn to Artemis
## First Principles
"Just as, when perfected, a human is the best of animals, so also when separated from law and justice, he is the worst of all."  
Aristotle  
  
It seems prudent, at the outset to set forth my purpose and the fundamental principles that guide it. I am writing here to record, analyze and reflect on events of my time for the benefit of those who contemporaneously may benefit from the discussion thereof and for those later readers who may find some illumination here of what transpired. The scope of my interest must, of course, be limited for the sake of space and time. So I will confine the subject to what can fairly be described as a series of curiously intriguing political events in the history of my country, the United States of America, during the first quarter of the Twenty-First Century. I suspect both that the consequences of the present turmoil may be as long-lasting as they are proving to be far-reaching and that what these events may teach us about human nature and its evident coordinates along the inevitable trajectory toward perfection is essential to our understanding of ourselves.  
  
To this undertaking especially, but in every action generally, I believe these virtues are essential.  
  
Gratitude. Any right act by a human person without gratitude for the opportunity risks the temptation to orient that act toward a selfish end thus limiting its benefit to society.  
  
Curiosity. Uncovering the truth of a thing, when dealing in human activity, often requires persistence, patience and endurance. Being curious brings with it the energy and attention to discover, record and dig deeper into matters where a superficial accounting would less service justice.  
  
Fidelity. To see any worthy project to a successful conclusion requires honesty and dedication to find the truth even if it challenges ones own presuppositions. Being faithful to both ones charge and princples is essential to stay on course.  
  
Courage. Facts can be frightening things, especially when they reveal unpleasant truths about human nature. Opposition may come from many directions. One must have courage to continue in the face of adversity.
